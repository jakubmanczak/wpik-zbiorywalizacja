Regarding the use of forms in AD 2026

    This project uses html forms so as to experiment with how things used to be. Remaining cognisant of both the positive and negative sides of frontend frameworks and the modern ways to send data, a small project like this one is a great opportunity to explore how to handle this without thousands of lines of heavy frontend framework code.

Regarding /web/styles.css

    The styles.css file, which is generated by a standalone Tailwind binary downloaded and executed automatically within build.rs, is to be committed any time it changes, as without it styling will be broken on the frontend part of the page.

    This is in contrast to a perhaps expected approach of gitignoring them and just generating them every build; this is incompatible with building docker images in an efficient way, however, as docker exposes no way to mount directories while retaining ability to write files and execute binaries.
